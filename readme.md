Kanban Board based on Node.js, React.js, PostgreSQL, Vite

I used:
# PERN stack starter

A boilerplate quickstart for using the PERN (Postgres sql, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.
Node.js and react.js are still (circa 2024, I've been writing react.js since 2014) very popular for building webapps. Traditional rdbms are still
rocksolid and prevalent in the software industry. The goals of this quickstart are to be able to
build a basic webapp quickly with modern versions of these technologies.
You can always add more things later to your liking, like react-router,
express middlewares, typescript, ORMs, etc. Those are outside of the scope for this project.
